This is my personal website! Through it, I hope to share a bit more about my experiences as a data science student, the great opportunities that I have been a part of, and some of my favorite projects.

The template used is the Prologue design from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/). However, given my love for design, I have made several modifications and additions to the HTML and CSS.
